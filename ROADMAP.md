# Chronos Roadmap

**Mission:** Build the PostgreSQL of GPU time-sharing - a solid, reliable binary that just works.

---

## Core Philosophy

Like PostgreSQL, Redis, or Git:
- ✅ **Solid core** - Rock-solid C++ implementation
- ✅ **Simple to use** - One binary, clear API
- ✅ **Well documented** - Great docs and examples
- ✅ **Stable API** - Backwards compatible
- ❌ **Not "enterprise"** - No dashboards, no SaaS features
- ❌ **Not a platform** - Just a tool

**Let others build:** Cloud offerings, web dashboards, monitoring tools, enterprise features.

## v1.2 (Q2 2025) - Advanced Features
**Focus:** Power user features while keeping it simple

### Core Enhancements
- [ ] Priority scheduling (high/normal/low)
- [ ] Partition queuing (wait for availability)
- [ ] Resource suggestions (`chronos suggest`)
- [ ] Better statistics (`chronos stats --detailed`)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] C# bindings (community)
- [ ] Java bindings (community)
- [ ] Rust bindings (community)
- [ ] Go bindings (community)

---

## v2.0 (Q3 2025) - Multi-GPU
**Focus:** Scale to multiple GPUs, maintain simplicity

### Multi-GPU Support
- [ ] Gang scheduling (allocate multiple GPUs atomically)
- [ ] Load balancing (auto-select least loaded GPU)
- [ ] GPU affinity (prefer specific GPUs)
- [ ] Multi-device statistics

### API Additions
- [ ] `chronos create --gpus 0,1,2,3` (gang scheduling)
- [ ] `chronos create --any` (auto-select GPU)
- [ ] `chronos stats --all` (all GPUs at once)

### Maintain Simplicity
- ✅ No configuration required
- ✅ Still a single binary
- ✅ No daemons or services
- ✅ Works out of the box

---

## What We're NOT Building

### ❌ Enterprise Features
- No web dashboard (let others build it)
- No REST API (not needed for core tool)
- No Prometheus metrics (add via wrapper if needed)
- No SAML/OAuth (use system auth)
- No multi-tenancy (single machine focus)

### ❌ Platform Features
- No cloud hosting
- No managed service
- No container orchestration
- No distributed systems

### ❌ Complex Features
- No ML for scheduling
- No predictive allocation
- No cost optimization
- No usage billing

**Why?** These are valuable but belong in layers built ON TOP of Chronos, not in it.

---

## Community Ecosystem

We provide the **solid foundation**. Others can build:

### Commercial Offerings
- 🏢 **Chronos Cloud** - Managed GPU sharing service
- 🏢 **Chronos Enterprise** - Web UI, LDAP, audit logs
- 🏢 **Chronos Analytics** - Usage tracking, billing

### Integration Tools
- 🔌 **Kubernetes Device Plugin** - K8s integration
- 🔌 **Slurm Integration** - HPC clusters
- 🔌 **Ray/Dask Plugin** - Distributed computing
- 🔌 **JupyterHub Extension** - Notebook integration

### Monitoring & Ops
- 📊 **Prometheus Exporter** - Metrics collection
- 📊 **Grafana Dashboard** - Visualization
- 📊 **Alerting Tools** - Monitoring

### Language Bindings
- 🐍 Python (official)
- 🦀 Rust (community)
- ☕ Java (community)
- 🔷 C# (community)
- 🐹 Go (community)

---

## Release Principles

### Every Release Must
1. **Work perfectly** - No breaking bugs
2. **Be documented** - Every feature explained
3. **Have examples** - Show how to use it
4. **Be tested** - Comprehensive test suite
5. **Be backwards compatible** - No API breaks

### We Won't Release Until
- All tests pass on all platforms
- Documentation is complete
- Examples work
- Performance is acceptable
- No critical bugs

**Quality over speed.** Better to delay than ship broken.

## FAQ

**Q: Why no REST API?**
A: It's not needed for the core tool. Add one via a wrapper if you need it.

**Q: Why no web dashboard?**
A: That's a separate project. We provide the foundation.

**Q: Will you add Kubernetes support?**
A: We'll help, but that's a separate device plugin project.

**Q: Can I build a commercial product on Chronos?**
A: Yes! That's the point. Apache 2.0 license allows it.

**Q: Will the API change?**
A: Not breaking changes. We're committed to stability.
