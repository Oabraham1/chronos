## Formal Algorithm Description

### Algorithm 1: CreatePartition

```
Input: deviceIndex d, memoryFraction f, duration t, targetUser u (optional)
Output: partitionId or ∅

1: if d ∉ [0, |Devices|) or f ∉ (0, 1] or t ≤ 0 then
2:     return ∅
3: end if
4:
5: ACQUIRE(partitionMutex)
6:
7: // Determine partition owner
8: currentUser ← GetCurrentUsername()
9: partitionOwner ← (u = ∅) ? currentUser : u
10:
11: // Check admin permissions for cross-user creation
12: if u ≠ ∅ and u ≠ currentUser then
13:    if not IsAdmin(currentUser) then
14:        RELEASE(partitionMutex)
15:        return ∅
16:    end if
17: end if
18:
19: // Check for conflicting locks
20: lockPath ← GenerateLockPath(d, f)
21: if EXISTS(lockPath) then
22:    owner ← ReadLockOwner(lockPath)
23:    if owner ≠ partitionOwner then
24:        RELEASE(partitionMutex)
25:        return ∅
26:    end if
27: end if
28:
29: // Admission control
30: device ← Devices[d]
31: requestedMemory ← device.totalMemory × f
32: if requestedMemory > device.availableMemory then
33:     RELEASE(partitionMutex)
34:     return ∅
35: end if
36:
37: // Create partition
38: partitionId ← GenerateUniqueId()
39: if not CreateLockFile(lockPath, partitionId, partitionOwner) then
40:     RELEASE(partitionMutex)
41:     return ∅
42: end if
43:
44: // Allocate memory enforcer
45: if not MemoryEnforcer.allocatePartition(partitionId, requestedMemory) then
46:     ReleaseLock(lockPath)
47:     RELEASE(partitionMutex)
48:     return ∅
49: end if
50:
51: // Update state
52: device.availableMemory ← device.availableMemory - requestedMemory
53: partition ← {
54:     id: partitionId,
55:     deviceId: device.id,
56:     memoryFraction: f,
57:     duration: t,
58:     startTime: NOW(),
59:     active: true,
60:     owner: partitionOwner,
61:     pid: GetCurrentProcessId()
62: }
63: Partitions.add(partition)
64:
65: RELEASE(partitionMutex)
66: return partitionId
```

### Algorithm 2: MonitorPartitions (Background Thread)

```
1: while running do
2:     ACQUIRE(partitionMutex)
3:     currentTime ← NOW()
4:
5:     for each partition p in Partitions do
6:         if p.active then
7:             elapsed ← currentTime - p.startTime
8:             if elapsed ≥ p.duration then
9:                 ReleasePartitionResources(p)
10:                p.active ← false
11:                LOG("Partition " + p.id + " expired and released")
12:            end if
13:        end if
14:    end for
15:
16:    // Remove inactive partitions
17:    Partitions.removeIf(p → not p.active)
18:
19:    RELEASE(partitionMutex)
20:    SLEEP(1 second)
21: end while
```

### Algorithm 3: ReleasePartition

```
Input: partitionId pid
Output: success (boolean)

1: ACQUIRE(partitionMutex)
2:
3: partition ← Partitions.find(p → p.id = pid)
4: if partition = ∅ or not partition.active then
5:     RELEASE(partitionMutex)
6:     return false
7: end if
8:
9: // Verify ownership
10: currentUser ← GetCurrentUsername()
11: if partition.owner ≠ currentUser then
12:     RELEASE(partitionMutex)
13:     LOG("Permission denied: partition owned by " + partition.owner)
14:     return false
15: end if
16:
17: // Release resources
18: ReleasePartitionResources(partition)
19: partition.active ← false
20:
21: RELEASE(partitionMutex)
22: LOG("Partition " + pid + " released")
23: return true
```

### Algorithm 4: ReleasePartitionResources (Helper)

```
Input: partition p
Output: void

1: deviceIdx ← GetDeviceIndex(p.deviceId)
2:
3: // Release memory enforcer resources
4: if MemoryEnforcer[deviceIdx] exists then
5:     MemoryEnforcer[deviceIdx].releasePartition(p.id)
6: end if
7:
8: // Release memory back to device
9: device ← FindDevice(p.deviceId)
10: freedMemory ← device.totalMemory × p.memoryFraction
11: device.availableMemory ← device.availableMemory + freedMemory
12:
13: // Release lock file
14: LockFile.releaseLock(deviceIdx, p.memoryFraction)
```

## Theoretical Properties

### Theorem 1: Mutual Exclusion

**Statement**: No two partitions can allocate overlapping memory regions on the same device for different users.

**Proof**: By construction, each partition request:
1. Acquires the global `partitionMutex` before checking and modifying device memory state
2. Checks for conflicting lock files and verifies ownership
3. Only proceeds if no conflicting lock exists or if the lock is owned by the same user

The lock file mechanism provides inter-process coordination. Combined with the mutex, this ensures that memory allocation decisions are serialized and user-isolated, preventing overlapping allocations between different users. □

### Theorem 2: Progress Guarantee

**Statement**: Every partition will eventually be released, ensuring system progress.

**Proof**: Each partition has a finite duration t. The monitor thread:
1. Runs continuously while the system is active
2. Checks all partitions every second
3. For any partition p with duration t, it will be released within time interval [t, t+1] seconds

This holds even if the creating process crashes, as:
- The monitor thread operates independently in the partitioner process
- Lock files persist on disk and are cleaned up by the monitor
- No manual intervention is required

Therefore, all partitions are guaranteed to expire. □

### Theorem 3: User Isolation

**Statement**: A user can only release their own partitions.

**Proof**: The ReleasePartition algorithm:
1. Retrieves the current user's username
2. Compares it with the partition owner
3. Returns false if they don't match
4. Only releases the partition if owner matches current user

This provides strong ownership semantics where users cannot interfere with each other's partitions. □

### Theorem 4: Eventual Consistency

**Statement**: After all active partitions expire, the system returns to full available capacity.

**Proof**:
- Each partition reserves exactly `totalMemory × memoryFraction` bytes
- When released (either manually or via expiration), `ReleasePartitionResources` adds this exact amount back to `device.availableMemory`
- The monitor thread removes all inactive partitions from the system
- No memory leaks occur as the enforcer and lock files are also cleaned up

Therefore, `device.availableMemory` eventually equals `device.totalMemory`. □

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| CreatePartition    | O(1)\*          | O(1)             | Lock file creation is atomic |
| ReleasePartition   | O(n)            | O(1)             | Linear search through partitions |
| ListPartitions     | O(n)            | O(n)             | Returns copy of active partitions |
| MonitorPartitions  | O(n)            | O(1)             | Checks all partitions per iteration |
| GetAvailableMemory | O(1)            | O(1)             | Direct device query |
| ReleaseResources   | O(1)            | O(1)             | Constant time cleanup operations |

\*Amortized, assuming constant number of devices and efficient lock file operations

Where:
- n = number of active partitions across all devices
- d = number of GPU devices

### Memory Usage

**Per Partition**:
- Partition struct: ~128 bytes
- Lock file on disk: ~256 bytes
- Memory enforcer tracking: O(b) where b = number of tracked buffers

**Total System**:
- O(n × (128 + 256 + b)) ≈ O(n × b) for typical cases
- Lock directory: ~10 KB per 100 partitions

### Performance Characteristics

**Latency** (from benchmarks on Apple M4):
- Partition creation: 0.65ms ± 0.16ms (mean ± stddev)
- Partition release: 0.21ms ± 0.04ms
- Monitor iteration: < 1ms for typical partition counts (< 50)

**Throughput**:
- Theoretical maximum: ~1,500 partition creations/second
- Practical limit: ~500 operations/second (considering disk I/O)
- Monitor overhead: < 0.1% CPU utilization

**Scalability**:
- Linear degradation with number of active partitions
- Suitable for < 1000 concurrent partitions
- Lock file system scales to millions of files (filesystem dependent)

## Implementation Details

### Lock File Format

Lock files use a simple key-value format:

```
/tmp/chronos_locks/gpu_<device>_<fraction*1000>.lock

Contents:
pid: <process_id>
user: <username>
host: <hostname>
time: <timestamp>
device: <device_index>
fraction: <memory_fraction>
partition: <partition_id>
```

**Example**:
```
/tmp/chronos_locks/gpu_0_0500.lock

pid: 12345
user: alice
host: workstation-01
time: 2025-10-19 14:30:00
device: 0
fraction: 0.5
partition: partition_0001
```

### Memory Fraction Encoding

Memory fractions are encoded as 4-digit integers (fraction × 1000):
- 0.1 (10%) → `0100`
- 0.5 (50%) → `0500`
- 0.75 (75%) → `0750`
- 1.0 (100%) → `1000`

This provides 0.1% granularity while maintaining filesystem-safe filenames.

### Partition ID Generation

Partition IDs follow the pattern: `partition_<counter>` where counter is a monotonically increasing 4-digit number with zero-padding:
- `partition_0001`
- `partition_0002`
- ...
- `partition_9999`

Counter resets to 1 when the partitioner process restarts.

### User Permission Model

**Regular Users**:
- Can create partitions for themselves
- Can release only their own partitions
- Can view all active partitions (read-only)
- Cannot create partitions for other users

**Administrators** (root or elevated):
- Can create partitions for any user (via `--user` flag)
- Can release any partition (implementation-dependent)
- Full system access

**Permission Check Logic**:
```
isAdmin = (currentUser == "root") || (effectiveUID == 0)
#ifdef _WIN32
    isAdmin = CheckTokenElevation()
#endif

if (targetUser != "" && targetUser != currentUser && !isAdmin)
    DENY
```

## Design Rationale

### Why Time-Based Partitioning?

1. **Predictability**: Users know exactly how long they have exclusive access
2. **Fairness**: Prevents indefinite resource hoarding
3. **Simplicity**: No complex scheduling algorithms required
4. **Self-Healing**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks
5. **Temporal QoS**: Guarantees access for a specific time window

### Why Filesystem-Based Locks?

1. **Portability**: Works across all operating systems (Unix, Windows, macOS)
2. **Persistence**: Survives process crashes
3. **Simplicity**: No kernel modifications or daemon required
4. **Visibility**: Lock files can be inspected for debugging
5. **Atomicity**: Filesystem provides atomic create operations
6. **Inter-Process**: Works across multiple processes and languages

### Why Per-Fraction Locks?

1. **Flexibility**: Multiple users can share the same device with different fractions
2. **Granularity**: 0.1% precision for memory allocation
3. **Collision Detection**: Prevents overlapping memory regions
4. **User Isolation**: Different users can use same device simultaneously

### Trade-offs

1. **Granularity**: 1-second monitoring interval trades precision for efficiency
   - Pro: Low CPU overhead (< 0.1%)
   - Con: Expiration accuracy ± 1 second

2. **Memory Fragmentation**: Fraction-based allocation may leave small unusable chunks
   - Pro: Simple mental model (percentages)
   - Con: May waste ~5-10% of memory in worst case

3. **Lock Contention**: Global mutex may become bottleneck at very high request rates
   - Pro: Guaranteed correctness and consistency
   - Con: Theoretical limit of ~1,500 ops/second
   - Mitigation: Acceptable for typical workloads (< 100 ops/second)

4. **Lock File I/O**: Disk operations add latency
   - Pro: Persistence and crash recovery
   - Con: ~1ms overhead per operation
   - Mitigation: Uses atomic operations, no locks held during I/O

### Future Optimizations

Potential improvements while maintaining the core design:

1. **Lock-Free Regions**: Use atomic operations for read-only queries
2. **Per-Device Mutexes**: Reduce contention for multi-GPU systems
3. **Lock File Caching**: Keep active locks in memory, sync periodically
4. **Partition Pooling**: Reuse partition IDs and memory allocations
5. **Adaptive Monitoring**: Adjust interval based on partition count and urgency

## Correctness Verification

### Invariants

The system maintains the following invariants:

**I1: Memory Conservation**
```
∀ device d:
    d.availableMemory + Σ(p.requestedMemory for p in d.partitions) = d.totalMemory
```

**I2: Lock Consistency**
```
∀ partition p:
    p.active ⟹ ∃ lockFile(p.device, p.fraction)
```

**I3: Ownership Integrity**
```
∀ partition p:
    lockFile(p.device, p.fraction).owner = p.owner
```

**I4: Temporal Bounds**
```
∀ partition p:
    p.active ⟹ (NOW() - p.startTime) < (p.duration + 1 second)
```

### Safety Properties

**S1: No Double Allocation**
```
¬∃ p1, p2 ∈ Partitions:
    p1 ≠ p2 ∧
    p1.device = p2.device ∧
    p1.fraction = p2.fraction ∧
    p1.owner ≠ p2.owner ∧
    p1.active ∧ p2.active
```

**S2: Authorization**
```
∀ operation ReleasePartition(pid):
    success ⟹ (partition[pid].owner = currentUser ∨ IsAdmin(currentUser))
```

### Liveness Properties

**L1: Eventual Release**
```
∀ partition p:
    p.active ⟹ ◇ ¬p.active
```
(All partitions eventually become inactive)

**L2: Resource Availability**
```
◇ (device.availableMemory = device.totalMemory)
```
(Eventually, all memory becomes available)
